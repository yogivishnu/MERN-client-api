- This repository can also be used as a starting point (boilerplate), if you whant to create your own React/Express app.
.

## About the app
Actually, there are two separated apps. The Client which serves the FrontEnd (using React), and the API (in Node/Express).

## How to run the API
1. In your terminal, navigate to the `api` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app.

## How to run the Client
1. In another terminal, navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app

## Check if they are connected
1. With the two apps running, open your browser in http://localhost:3000/.
2. If you see a webpage saying `Welcome to React`, it means the FrontEnd is working.
3. If the same webpage has the phrase `API is working properly`, it means the API is working.
4. Enjoy!
